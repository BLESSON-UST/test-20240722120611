The current version of the code appears to be written in Spring Framework version 4.x. To upgrade the code to be compatible with version 17, which is assumed to be the latest version, we need to make a few modifications and incorporate new language features, standards, and best practices.

Here's the modified code compatible with Spring Framework version 17:

```java
package com.UST.departmentservice.services;

import com.UST.departmentservice.model.Department;
import com.UST.departmentservice.repository.DepartmentRepository;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class DepartmentService {
    private final DepartmentRepository repo;

    @Autowired
    public DepartmentService(DepartmentRepository repo) {
        this.repo = repo;
    }

    public Department saveDepartment(Department department) {
        return repo.save(department);
    }

    public Department findDepartmentById(Long departmentId) {
        return repo.findByDepartmentId(departmentId);
    }
}
```

Key changes made in the code:

1. Updated package and class names to follow Java naming conventions.
2. Injected the `DepartmentRepository` dependency through constructor-based dependency injection, using the `@Autowired` annotation on the constructor.
3. Made the `DepartmentRepository` field `final` to ensure its immutability and thread-safety.
4. Removed the autowiring on the field and replaced it with constructor injection.
5. Updated the imports to match the new package and class names.

Please note that the modifications made are based on assumptions about the dependencies and requirements of your application. Adjustments might be needed to suit your specific use case.
