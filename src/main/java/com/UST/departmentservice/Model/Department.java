The given code is written in Java and uses the Lombok library for generating getters, setters, and constructors. 

To upgrade the code to be compatible with version 17, we can make the following changes:
- Use records instead of the `@Data`, `@NoArgsConstructor`, and `@AllArgsConstructor` annotations
- Update the imports to reflect the changes in the package structure for Java 17
- Add the `final` keyword to the class and field declarations

Here is the modified code:

```java
package com.ust.departmentservice.model;

import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.Id;

@Entity
public record Department(
        @Id
        @GeneratedValue
        private final Long departmentId,
        private final String departmentName,
        private final String departmentAddress,
        private final String departmentCode) {
}
```

Please note that I have assumed the package and class names based on the original code.
