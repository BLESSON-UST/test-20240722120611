The provided code appears to be written in Java. It uses JUnit 5 and Spring Boot testing annotations, indicating it is likely written in a version compatible with Java 8 or later.

Here's the modified code upgraded to be compatible with Java 17, incorporating latest language features, standards, and best practices:

```java
package com.UST.departmentservice;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;

@SpringBootTest
class DepartmentServiceApplicationTests {

    @Test
    void contextLoads() {
        // Tests the context loading of the application
        // Additional test cases can be added here
    }

}
```

No changes were necessary for this code since it already follows best practices and the Spring Boot test framework handles the necessary setup and execution for testing the application's context loading.
